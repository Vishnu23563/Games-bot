# This file provides documentation about the data used in the project, including its structure, sources, and any preprocessing steps.

## Data Structure
The data used in this project consists of various features that are essential for training the AI game bot. The dataset is structured as follows:

- **Features**: A list of numerical values representing the state of the game.
- **Labels**: The corresponding actions that the bot should take based on the features.

## Data Sources
The data is sourced from [insert source here, e.g., game logs, simulations, etc.]. Ensure that the data is collected in a consistent format to maintain the integrity of the training process.

## Preprocessing Steps
Before using the data for training, the following preprocessing steps are applied:

1. **Normalization**: Features are normalized to ensure that they are on a similar scale.
2. **Encoding**: Categorical variables are encoded into numerical values if applicable.
3. **Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Usage
To use the data in the project, ensure that it is placed in the appropriate directory and that the paths are correctly referenced in the code.
